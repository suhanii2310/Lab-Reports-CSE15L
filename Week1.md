## Step 2-Remotely Connecting
- For this step, I first checked if I had **git** installed on my computer.To do this we first open the terminal and type "git --version".
- If it results in an error then we need to install **git**
- After installing git we will use the ssh command to connect it to the server.
- Type the following command in the terminal.
-     **ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu**
- We have to replace "zz" by our course-specific account. For me it was "awl".
- It will ask you if you want to continue, type "yes".
- The termainal will ask you to enter your password.
- After entering the password the connnection will be established and something like this should be on your screen.
