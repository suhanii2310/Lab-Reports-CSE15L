# Week 9 Lab Report

## Researching Commands (find)

## Command 1 (find -name)

- This command line option of find is used when we know the name of the file and want to know its location.
- We can explain this using the following examples
- In example 1, we search for a file named `HistoryIndia.txt`. The output shows that the file was found in the directory `./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/`.
- Similarly in example 2, we search for a file named `HistoryItaly.txt`. The output shows that the file was found in the directory `./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/`.

Example 1
```
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % find . -name HistoryIndia.txt
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryIndia.txt
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch %
```

Example 2

```
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % find . -name HistoryItaly.txt  
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryItaly.txt
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch %
```

## Command 2 (find -iname)

- This command line option of find is used to conduct a case-insensitive search. With `-iname` the search pattern is not affected by the case of the letters.
- To understand this better we can use the following examples.
- In example 1, we search for a file named `HiStoRyHawAiI.txt`. The output shows that the file was found in the directory `./written_2/travel_guid`. It doesnt matter in what case we type the filename.
- Similarly, in example 2 we search for the file `Athens-Intro.txt`. We entered the search pattern as `"AtHenS-INTro.txt"` the command searches for all the files containing this string irrespective of the case. The fiel was found in the directory `./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-Intro.txt`.

Example 1 

```
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % find . -iname HiStoRyHawAiI.txt 
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryHawaii.txt
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % 
```

Example 2

```
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % find . -iname AtHenS-INTro.txt 
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-Intro.txt
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % 
```

## Command 3 (find -type f -name <filename> -exec rm -f {} \;)
- The `-type` option is used to specify the type of file to search for. The `-name` option is used to specify the name of the file to search for. The `-exec` option is used to execute a command `-rm -f` to remove the file.
- We can understand these with the following examples. 
- In example 1, the command searches for the file `"Cancun-WhereToGo.txt"` and then uses -exec to execute the `-rm -f` command to delete the file. We check if the file was deleted or not by using `-name` command to search for this file. We observe that it doesn't return anything which means the file was deleted.
- Similarly in the second example, the command searches for the file `"Cuba-History.txt"` and then uses -exec to execute the `-rm -f` command to delete the file. We check if the file was deleted or not by using `-name` command to search for this file. We see that it doesn't return anything which means the file was deleted.

Example 1

```
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % find . -type f -name "Cancun-WhereToGo.txt" -exec rm -f {} \;
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % find . -name Cancun-WhereToGo.txt         
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % 
```
Example 2

```
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % find . -type f -name "Cuba-History.txt" -exec rm -f {} \;
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % find . -name Cuba-History.txt                            
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 docsearch % 
```

## Command 4 (find . -mtime)

- This command line option is used to find all the files that were modified within the last few days(number entered).
- We can understand this using the following examples.
- In the first example, the command `-mtime -2` returns all the files that were modified in the last two days. This returns `./travel_guides/berlitz2`
- Similarly in the second example the command `-mtime -40` returns all the files that were modified in the last forty days.

Example 1

```
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 written_2 % find . -mtime -2
./travel_guides/berlitz2
```

Example 2

```
suhanisrivastava@Suhanis-MacBook-Air-2 written_2 % find . -mtime -40
.

# The Source
  
I used google to find out about the below sites to find command line options.
I searched for "find command line options" and clicked on the following sites.
  
## Source 1
- I used this site to look for the comands `-name` and `-type f -name <filename> -exec rm -f {} \;`.
